# nina-sequence-viewer
Simple js / html sequence reader for NINA Astrophotography software

This is a simple NINA sequence viewer.
As I am not a coder it was made using AI tools.
It works for my sequences but maybe not for yours.
The "code" is public domain so feel free to use, modify, distribute.
My coding skills being close to 0, do not expect any support, sorry.
